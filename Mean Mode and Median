Categorical data are called as Qualitative data and Numerical data is known as Quantitative data


1. Mean:-
  It is the average of the data given. It is basically useful when the data is basically symmetrical and shows one type of trends.
  
  -- summation(x)/n ; x is the each value and n is the total number of value
  * We can not rely on statistics when there is a skew in the data.
  
 2. Median:-
 It is also type of average when the data is skewed because of the outliners.
 If there are odd number of values , the median is one of the middle.
 If there are even number of values , the median is the sum of the two values and divide it by 2.
 
 3. Mode:-
 It is also type of an average where we have to choose the value having the highest frequency.
 If the data is having two clusters , report a mode for each group.
 It is the only type of average you can calculate for categorical data in the  mode.
 The data where there are two modes are known as bimodal.
